<h5 align = "center"> Application functionality </h5>
- Open a video file (WMV/AVI/MP4)
- Play the video
- Adjust video size

<h5 align = "center">How it works</h5>
<p> WPF provides us a nice library for media playback, so for playing a video file we have to create a media player object, a drawing brush and fill a rectangle on the window with the drawing brush.  </p>

<h5 align = "center"> Conclusion </h5>
<p> By performing this laboratory work we learned how to work with video files and devices capable of video recording like the laptop's webcam.</p>
