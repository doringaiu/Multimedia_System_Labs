<h4> <b>Titile:</b> Image Manipulation </h4>
<h4> <b>Tasks:</b></h4> 
- Develop a desktop application that loads one or more images from a file and displays them in a
window. [Action] can also be performed on them, by using UI controls (buttons, text input fields etc.)
- Adjust contrast (0-100%)
- adjust brightness (0-100%)
- save resulting image.

<h5 align = "center"> Application functionality </h5>
<p> This application can load an image from the computer and display it in the picturebox. With the sliders located on the right, we can adjust the image brightness or contrast. We can save the adjusted image in the original size by overwriting the original file or saving as a new file. The image processing is done by manipulating each pixel of the image individualy according to specific formula for brightness or contrast. The functions which perform the adjustment operations accept a parameter, in our case we use the value of the slider. </p>

<h5 align = "center"> Conclusion </h5>
<p> In this laboratory work we learned how to manipulate the properties of an image. The processing in our case is efficient for small images but as we load larger pictures , the processing becomes very slow because a high number of operations is required for adjustments. </p>
